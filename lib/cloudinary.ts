// This file is for demonstration purposes only.
// In a real Next.js application, this configuration and the upload logic
// should reside in a server-side environment (e.g., a Next.js API Route or Server Action)
// and use your Cloudinary API Secret, which MUST NOT be exposed client-side.

// You would typically install the Cloudinary SDK: npm install cloudinary
// import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary';

// This is how you would configure Cloudinary on your server:
/*
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, // This can be public
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, // This should be private
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, // This MUST be private
  secure: true,
});

export default cloudinary;
*/

// For v0's client-side environment, we'll just export a placeholder for the cloud name.
// In your actual backend, you'd use the full cloudinary object.
export const CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
